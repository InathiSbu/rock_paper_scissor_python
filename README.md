Rock-Paper-Scissors
Project Desciption:
  This is a simple implementation of the classic rock,paper scissors game that allows the user to have three attempts. The user can quit anytime.It prints out the final score when completed
Project challenges:
  Implementing the scoring feature posed a challenge initially. However, with thorough research and effort, I successfully integrated this functionality into the game.
Future features:
      I want  to add a  simple graphical interface to make it more engaging
To Run
  Execute the following command on terminal
  python3 Rock_paper_scissor.py
